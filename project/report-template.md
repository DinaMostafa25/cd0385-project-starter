# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### Dina Mostafa Osman

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
TODO: i needed to clear the cell's output as the file size was very large, but it failed also so i submited the submissions.csv file only

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
TODO: the model with added new features

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
TODO: i found that not all the features has the same distribution and i added new features from datetime column with .dt method

### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
TODO: my score is improved from 1.84672 to .59398 which means the model performed much better

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
TODO: my score is improved from .59398 to  .77911 which means the model performes less betetr

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
TODO: in Hyper parameter tuning

### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.
